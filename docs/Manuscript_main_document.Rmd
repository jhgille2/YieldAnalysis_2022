# Abstract

# Introduction

- Importance of yield.
- Importance of oil, protein coupled with oil. Stats on worldwide meal consumption, value contributed by high protein. 
- Difficulty in simultaneously increasing yield, protein.
- Need for diverse germplasm with high protein, yield, good agronomic qualities.

# Materials and Methods
## Pedigree

- Brief details about the populations they were selected from
  - Number of RILs in each population
  - Population parents, parental pedigree (perhaps supplementary for detailed pedigrees)
  
## Population development

- Criteria for selection from the starting RIL populations. 
  - Two trials per RIL population.
- How were lines selected for progression to the 2020 season.
  - Two trials in total. 


## Plot techniques

- Plot techniques: How many rows, row lengh, spacing, seeding rate (from lead sheets)
- How data was converted between three-row and four-row trials

## Phenotypic data collection

- List each relevant phenotype and how it was measured
  - Yield, protein/oil, logding, agronomic score, seed weight.

## Statistical analysis

- Statistical model used to analyze data, fixed vs random effects what software was used. 
  - Model used.
  - ANOVA results for model term significance (mainly genotype).
  - Software used to fit the model
  - How were genotype means compared (LSD?)

# Results and Discussion

- Report agronomic performance of well performing lines. 
  - Well performing lines are those with yield within a LSD of the check average.
  - Report yield, maturity, lodging, heinght, seed weight, seed protein, seed oil, and meal protein. 
    - Meal protein maybe from the SPROC program(?) **look into how to calculate this**
