AB The yield and protein performance in a soybean genotype result from its interaction with the prevailing environmental conditions. This makes selecting the best genotypes under varied target production environments more complex. This study's objectives were to determine protein content and protein stability of 30 elite soybean genotypes in major soybean-growing areas of Uganda, assess the yield performance and stability in soybeans and determine the relationship between the protein content and grain yield in soybeans. The genotypes were planted in a randomized complete block design of three replications for six seasons across eight locations in Uganda. Genotype and genotype-by-environment (GGE) biplot analyses classified the test locations into three mega-environments for soybean protein and grain yields. Genotype NII X GC 20.3 had the highest mean protein content of 43.0%, and BSPS 48A-9-2 and BSPS 48A-28 were superior for the mean grain yield (1207 kg ha(-1)). Bulindi was the most discriminating and representative test environment for soybean yield. A weak and negative correlation (r = -0.1**, d.f. = 29) was detected between the protein content (%) and yield (kg ha(-1)). The highest-yielding genotypes BSPS 48A-9-2, BSPS 48A-31, and Nam II x GC 44.2 are recommended for further evaluation under farmers' production conditions for selection and release as new soybean varieties in Uganda.

AB Soybean can play an important role in securing the European protein resources. The goal of the breeder was to create highly productive soybean varieties, followed by quality grain. In this regard soybean breeding program at NARDI Fundulea has been involved in improving the genetic yield and quality potential to meet the need of farmers in different parts of the country. The objective of this study was to evaluate the variability of five soybean genotypes (created at NARDI Fundulea) from different maturity groups, grown at the National Agricultural Research and Development Institute Fundulea in 2017-2019, for yield, protein content and oil content. The year had statistically significant effect for the studied agronomic traits, p<0.01.
   The average yield for all genotypes was 2952 kg/ha. The highest grain yield on an average was recorded in genotype Crina F (41/9%).
   The average protein content of all examined genotypes was 40.07%. 2017 was the most favorable year for protein synthesis. The average oil content for all examined genotypes was Camelia F (23/77%). The most favorable year for oil synthesis was 2019 (23/48%).
   This research had evidentiated that new soybean genotypes created at NARDI Fundulea are suitable for new climatic conditions and can constitute the basis for further soybean breeding adapted to farmers' requirements.

AB The conventional soybean production has been reestablishing itself every year, due to the fact that the international market has demanded products with high agronomic performance and nutritional quality, free of genetically modified organisms. This study aimed to evaluate the adaptability of conventional soybean genotypes in the southwestern Goias state (Rio Verde, Montividiu and Santa Helena de Goias), Brazil, during the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 crop seasons. A randomized blocks design was used, being tested eight genotypes (the cultivars BRS284, BRS283, BRS232, BRS317, NT11-1277, INT3459 and M6101 and the line NT1478SP). The grain and oil yields, as well as the oil and protein contents, were evaluated. Multi-environment analyses were performed using a heterogeneous residual variance model, and the GGE biplot analysis was used to describe the interrelationships between genotypes and environments. The most adapted and stable genotypes were BRS 317 for grain yield and BRS 283 for oil yield. They also corresponded more closely to the ideotype for the specific region, thus proving to be promising. NT1478SP showed the highest protein content. In the 2018/2019 crop season, Montividiu was more discriminating for the conventional soybean production, regarding grain and oil yields.

AB An experiment was conducted to evaluate the genotypic-phenotypic variability and environmental effect in 20 pure lines and varieties (PLV) of soybean, and observations were recorded on various characters affecting quality, such as palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic and linolenic acid, oil and protein content. High values of GCV and PCV were observed for features such as grain yield (14.89, 11.13) and oleic acid (13.13, 12.73) and linolenic acid (11.29, 10.33) content, which indicates the presence of high genetic variation. Analysis of phenotypic and genotypic correlation coefficients of quantitative characters and partitioning of the genotypic correlation to the grain revealed that the correlation coefficients of grain yield with oil content were positive and significant. The linolenic acid content showed the highest positive direct effect on grain yield. High heritability coupled with the high genetic advance observed for the traits and contents of oleic, linoleic, and linolenic acids indicates the presence of additive gene action and demands population improvement by selection.

AB Peric V., M. Srebric, A. Nikolic, D. Ristic, S.Mladenovic Drinic, Z. Dumanovic (2021). Stability of yield and seed composition in early maturing soybean genotypes assessed by AMMI analysis.- Genetika, Vol 53, No.1,323-338. Identification of stable sources for breeding for important agronomic traits is prerequisite for providing a continuous and long-term progress in breeding. In this study, thirty-one early-maturing genotypes from soybean collection of Maize Research Institute "Zemun Polje" were evaluated across four environments (two years and two locations) according to randomized complete block design with three replications. The aim of research was to examine the value of the interaction of genotype and environment for three important agronomic traits (seed yield, protein content and oil content) using anadditive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) statistical model, and to identify stable sources for breeding for listed traits. The results of the research indicated that all traits were strongly influenced by environmental factors, while the influence of genotype and particularly interaction of genotype and environment was of less importance. AMMI analysis enabled identification of genotypes with above average value and high stability for seed yield (three genotypes), protein content (three genotypes) and oil content (two genotypes), which could be utilized as potential stable sources of variability in future soybean breeding programs.

AB Manipulating seed oil content and composition is a major goal for plant biotechnologists. However, some of these modifications generate undesired effects, affecting plant growth and yield, and, thereby, decreasing market value. In this work, Lakhssassi et al. (2020) describe the application of an improved TILLING technique (TILLING-by-sequencing+) that was successful in obtaining soybean lines with mutations in novel members of the GmSACPD family. These lines showed higher stearic acid levels without compromising nodulation and growth yield. This work shows how powerful the joint utilization of conventional TILLING techniques and next-generation sequencing can be, helping breeders and biotechnologists to overcome metabolic bottlenecks or undesirable growth phenotypes.

AB Test weight (TW) is a primary indicator of soybean grain quality and measure of bulk density (mass/volume). The objectives of this research were to evaluate the effects of genotype, environment and planting date on TW, and determine the relationship of TW with agronomic and seed composition traits. Six experiments (Exp) were conducted using diverse sets of cultivars/experimental lines. Significant negative linear correlations between TW and seed moisture in each of five genotypes were observed (P < 0.0001). A linear regression model using both measured TW and moisture were developed to normalize TW on a 13% moisture basis for comparison across genotypes and environments. Significant genetic variations (P < 0.01) of TW among genotypes were observed, ranging from 70.0 to 75.3; 70.3 to 74.3; and 66.4 to 74.3 kg hL(-1) in Exp-1, 2, and 3, respectively. Locations and G x E interactions also had significant effects on TW (P < 0.01) in these EXPs. Soybean yield was significantly negatively correlated with TW in Exp-1 and 3 (P < 0.01). Seed protein and sucrose contents, and maturity days were significantly, positively correlated with TW, while seed oil content and seed size were significantly, negatively correlated with TW in most or all experiments (P < 0.05). Effects of planting dates on TW were inconsistent for both Exp-4 and 5 between 2 years. There was no correlation between TW of the cultivars and their releasing years in MG VII. To our knowledge, this is the first report on test weight in soybean and the results could be used to guide future genetic improvement of TW.

AB Improvement of agronomic and seed quality traits in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] occurs in breeding programs as a result of crossing elite soybean genotypes and selection of superior offspring in each cycle. The objective of this study was to evaluate changes in traits over 100 yr of selection in Ontario, Canada, in two soybean breeding programs at the University of Guelph: Guelph Campus (Maturity Group [MG] 0 and I) and Ridgetown Campus (MG II) programs. Fifty-six Guelph cultivars (released between 1983 and 2016), 46 Ridgetown cultivars (released between 1987 and 2015), and 37 Guelph-pedigree related historical cultivars (from 1913 to 1985) were grown in field trials over 3 yr (Guelph Campus) and 2 yr (Ridgetown Campus) at two locations per breeding program to measure 13 traits. Yield increased in the Guelph Campus cultivars by 17.1 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) and by 15.7 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) in the Ridgetown Campus cultivars, while yield per day of maturity per year of release significantly increased in elite cultivars. Protein in the Ridgetown Campus cultivars increased at 0.76 g kg(-1) yr(-1), whereas the Guelph Campus cultivars showed no trend. In Ridgetown Campus cultivars 100-seed weight significantly increased at 0.1 g yr(-1). Within the historical cultivars, 100-seed weight was significantly correlated with both protein (r = 0.50) and oil (r = -0.42). Genotype x trait biplot analyses revealed differential patterns of trait relationships between the elite and historical cultivars. Oil and yield were associated within the Guelph Campus cultivars. The association of 100-seed weight and protein was only found in the historical cultivars. Yield has increased in both breeding programs while seed traits have been altered over time.

AB Genomic selection (GS) has become viable for selection of quantitative traits for which marker-assisted selection has often proven less effective. The potential of GS for soybean was characterized using 483 elite breeding lines, genotyped with BARCSoySNP6K iSelect BeadChips. Cross validation was performed using RR-BLUP and predictive abilities (r(MP)) of 0.81, 0.71, and 0.26 for protein, oil, and yield, were achieved at the largest tested training set size. Minimal differences were observed when comparing different marker densities and there appeared to be inflation in r(MP) due to population structure. For comparison purposes, two additional methods to predict breeding values for lines of four bi-parental populations within the GS dataset were tested. The first method predicted within each bi-parental population (WP method) and utilized a training set of full-sibs of the validation set. The second method utilized a training set of all remaining breeding lines except for full-sibs of the validation set to predict across populations (AP method). The AP method is more practical as the WP method would likely delay the breeding cycle and leverage smaller training sets. Averaging across populations for protein and oil content, r(MP) for the AP method (0.55, 0.30) approached r(MP) for the WP method (0.60, 0.52). Though comparable, r(MP) for yield was low for both AP and WP methods (0.12, 0.13). Based on increases in r(MP) as training sets increased and the effectiveness of WP vs. AP method, the AP method could potentially improve with larger training sets and increased relatedness between training and validation sets.

AB Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] seed composition and yield are a function of genetics (G), environment (E), and management (M) practices, but contribution of each factor to seed composition and yield are not well understood. The goal of this synthesis-analysis was to identify the main effects of G, E, and M factors on seed composition (protein and oil concentration) and yield. The entire dataset (13,574 data points) consisted of 21 studies conducted across the United States (US) between 2002 and 2017 with varying treatments and all reporting seed yield and composition. Environment (E), defined as site-year, was the dominant factor accounting for more than 70% of the variation for both seed composition and yield. Of the crop management factors: (i) delayed planting date decreased oil concentration by 0.007 to 0.06% per delayed week (R-2 similar to 0.70) and a 0.01 to 0.04 Mg ha(-1) decline in seed yield per week, mainly in northern latitudes (40-45 N); (ii) crop rotation (corn-soybean) resulted in an overall positive impact for both seed composition and yield (1.60 Mg ha(-1) positive yield difference relative to continuous soybean); and (iii) other management practices such as no-till, seed treatment, foliar nutrient application, and fungicide showed mixed results. Fertilizer N application in lower quantities (10-50 kg N ha(-1)) increased both oil and protein concentration, but seed yield was improved with rates above 100 kg N ha(-1). At southern latitudes (30-35 N), trends of reduction in oil and increases in protein concentrations with later maturity groups (MG, from 3 to 7) was found. Continuing coordinated research is critical to advance our understanding of G x E x M interactions.

AB During the years 2017 and 2018, field studies were carried out on the impact of year, location and interaction of genotype x location and genotype x year on yield, oil and protein content of soybean seed. The experiment included twenty most common soybean genotypes of different maturation groups, which have a 75% share in the sowing structure. The experiment was set up on locations Osijek and Kutjevo, in two repetitions, in a randomized block design. In 2018, an average higher seed yield, oil content and protein content were achieved primarily due to proper distribution of rainfall. Location Osijek in years of research had an average higher seed yield, and oil and protein content. According to the obtained results of the variance analysis for genotype, interaction of genotype x location and genotype x year, statistically highly justified differences (P <0.01) were obtained for seed yield. For genotype and interaction of genotype x year, statistically justified differences (P <0.05) were obtained for the oil and protein content. Research results will contribute to the proper selection of genotypes depending on the purpose of production in order to exploit the genetic potential of the genotype which is most suitable for a particular location.

AB As consumers look for healthier dietary alternatives, many have recognized soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] as a prominent source of high quality protein. The major obstacles to developing commercially competitive high protein food-grade soybean cultivars are the complex inheritance of seed protein concentration and its inverse association with yield. A better understanding of the genetic background and environmental conditions influencing soybean seed protein, and its relationship with yield, can facilitate the development of superior high-protein cultivars. Therefore, the main objective of this research was to study the influence of genotype and genotype-by-environment interaction effects (GGE) on seed protein and yield, and their relationship, using two recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations. The RIL populations were derived from crosses between a high-protein cultivar, AC X790P (486gkg(-1), dry weight basis), and two moderate-protein elite cultivars, S18-R6 (404gkg(-1)) and S23-T5 (413gkg(-1)), and were evaluated in a multi-environment trial in southwestern Ontario, Canada, in 2015 and 2016. Significant (P<0.05) phenotypic variation was observed for seed protein and yield in both populations within and across environments. The effects of genotype, environment, and GE interactions on both traits were significant in both populations. Genotypic main effect plus GGE biplot analyses led to the identification of stable high yielding high-protein RILs for the sub-regions and individual testing environments. These results indicated that the association between seed protein and yield can be manipulated using specific genetic backgrounds and environments, and superior genotypes for target regions can be identified using GGE biplots.

AB The use of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] is widespread, with applications in food, fuel, livestock feed, and industrial products. We developed a soybean population of 239 F-4-derived recombinant inbred lines (RIL) from the cross "5601T" x U99-310255 to estimate the heritability and genetic gain for seed protein, oil, and yield, and to assess the utility of making selections for these important traits. Heritability estimates on an entry means basis for protein (0.78), oil (0.65), seed yield (0.38) varied by trait with regard to genetic influence. Genetic gain was calculated for each trait at 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% selection intensities. With the genetic gain that was obtained through the selections for each trait, some lines excelled above that of the checks and parents in this population. The second and third highest yielding selections (56U99-081 and 56U99-244) are notable in producing 50.2% and 49.8% meal protein, respectively, while maintain high yields above the high-yielding parent, 5601T. Seeking balance for these important soybean traits is essential for breeders looking to make optimal improvements for the wide variety of soybean uses. Further research on this population could prove to be of value to breeding programs wishing to increase seed yield, oil, and protein.

AB Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] has been studied and enhanced for most of its economically important traits. Previous research has studied the association among them and the effect of the genotype x environment interaction; however, less is known about their correlation considering absolute maturity, as well as the use of multiple selection indices to study the genotype x environment interaction and select superior cultivars. Regarding this, the aim of the present study was to identify lines that associate precocity, good yield performance, and high oil and protein contents in the grains, as well as to estimate the correlation among these traits and study the effect of genotype x environment interaction using a standardized multiple selection index. Trials were conducted in two crop seasons in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, with 39 lines in 13 evaluation environments. The experiments were conducted in a randomized complete block design with four replications, and the grain yield, absolute maturity, and oil and protein contents in the grains were evaluated. The results indicated high experimental precision and accuracy, with significant differences among lines for all traits. High-magnitude correlations between evaluated traits were found, highlighting the negative correlation between absolute maturity and protein content in the grains. The genotype x environment interaction was also significant, and the use of the multiple selection index was efficient to identify superior and stable inbred lines by the genotype + genotype x environment (GGE) biplot method, which explained 82.23% of the genotype x environment interaction effect. Lines 27 and 31 stood out from the others because they associated stability and good performance for all evaluated traits.

AB The aim of this study was to determine the performances of yield and factors affecting the yield of 9 soybean lines and 2 standard soybean varieties grown in the soybean production seasons of 2012 and 2013 under semi-arid climatic conditions. The results indicated that performances of yield and other characteristics of soybean varieties/lines obtained in both trial seasons were significantly different from each other. The average temperature of experimental site in the first plant growing season was higher than that of the second year. The difference in temperatures between two growing seasons adversely influenced the yield, parameters affecting the yield and some quality parameters. Negative relationship between soybean yield and the temperature, an environmental factor that cannot be controlled during the growing season of the soybean, was obtained.

AB Typical soybean oil is composed of palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic and linolenic acids. High oleic acid content in soybean seed is a key compositional trait that improves oxidative stability and increases oil functionality and shelf life. Using a marker-assisted selection method, near-isogenic lines (NILs) of G00-3213 for the high oleic trait were developed and yield tested. These NILs have various combinations of FAD2-1A and FAD2-1B alleles that were derived from the same backcrossing populations. The results indicated that G00-3213 NILs with both homozygous mutant FAD2-1A and FAD2-1B alleles produced an average of 788g/kg oleic acid content. The results also demonstrated that possessing these mutant alleles did not cause a yield reduction. Furthermore, seed germination tests across 12 temperatures (12.8-32.0 degrees C) showed that modified seed composition for oleic acid in general did not have a major impact on seed germination. However, there was a possible reduction in seed germination vigour when high oleic seeds are planted in cold soil. The mutant FAD2-1A and FAD2-1B alleles did not hinder either seed or plant development.

AB Study of the interaction between genotype (G) and year (Y) provides good estimates of genotypes breeding values. In order to investigate the main effects of G, Y and G x Y interactions on yield and quality components of NS soybean genotypes, an experiment with genotypes of different maturity groups was carried out during three-year period. The average yield for all genotypes was 4,716 kg ha(-1). Genotype, year and interaction G x Y had statistically significant effect on the yield, p<0.05, p<0.01. The highest grain yields per unit area had, on an average, was recorded in genotype Venera (4,962 kg ha(-1)), significantly higher than genotype Vojvodjanka (4,522 kg ha(-1)), p<0.05. The highest yield stability was recorded by genotypes of MG 0.
   The average protein content of all examined genotypes was 37.60%. Year, genotype and G x Y interaction had statistically significant effects on protein content. Genotype Galina had on an average the highest protein content (38.11%), significantly higher than genotypes Trijumf, Valjevka and Venera, p<0.05. Significantly higher protein content was achieved during 2008 and 2009 compared with 2010, p<0.05, p<0.01. Average protein yield for all genotypes was 1,711 kg ha(-1). The highest protein yields had genotype Venera, significantly higher than genotype Vojvodjanka, p<0.05. The average oil content for all examined genotypes was 21.51%. The most favorable year for oil synthesis in the test period was 2008 (22.41%). Statistically significantly higher oil content was recorded in 2008 (22.41%) compared to 2010 (20.22%) and significantly higher than in 2009 (21.89%), p<0.05. Genotype Valjevka (21.78%) had on average significantly higher oil content than genotype Trijumf, p<0.05. The average oil yield for all genotypes was 1,014 kg ha(-1). On average the highest oil yield was recorded in genotype Venera. The yield was negatively statistically significant correlated with protein content, highly negatively significant correlated with air temperature and positively significant correlated by protein yield, oil yield and precipitation.
   The goal of the breeder was to create highly productive soybean varieties, followed by quality grain. This research can constitute the basis for further soybean breeding.

AB The aim of this study was to verify the adaptability and stability of soybean cultivars with regards to yield and oil content. Data of soybean yield and oil content were used from experiments set up in six environments in the 2011/12 and 2012/13 crop seasons in the municipalities of Patos de Minas, Uberaba, Lavras, and Sao Gotardo, Minas Gerais, Brazil, testing 36 commercial soybean cultivars of both conventional and transgenic varieties. The Wricke method and GGE biplot analysis were used to evaluate adaptability and stability of these cultivars. Large variations were observed in grain yield in relation to the different environments studied, showing that these materials are adaptable. The cultivars exhibited significant differences in oil content. The cultivars BRSGO204 (Goiania) and BRSMG (Garantia) exhibited the greatest average grain yield in the different environments studied, and the cultivar BRSMG 760 SRR had the greatest oil content among the cultivars evaluated. Ecovalence was adopted to identify the most stable cultivars, and the estimates were nearly uniform both for grain yield and oil content, showing a variation of 0.07 and 0.01%, respectively. The GGE biplot was efficient at identifying cultivars with high adaptability and phenotype stability.

AB Increasing the oil concentration in soybean seeds has been given more attention in recent years because of demand for both edible oil and biodiesel production. Oil concentration in soybean is a complex quantitative trait regulated by many genes as well as environmental conditions. To identify genes governing seed oil concentration in soybean, 16 putative candidate genes of three important gene families (GPAT: acyl-CoA:sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, DGAT: acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase, and PDAT: phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase) involved in triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthesis pathways were selected and their sequences retrieved from the soybean database (http://www.phytozome.net/soybean). Three sequence mutations were discovered in either coding or noncoding regions of three DGAT soybean isoforms when comparing the parents of a 203 recombinant inbreed line (RIL) population; OAC Wallace and OAC Glencoe. The RIL population was used to study the effects of these mutations on seed oil concentration and other important agronomic and seed composition traits, including seed yield and protein concentration across three field locations in Ontario, Canada, in 2009 and 2010. An insertion/deletion (indel) mutation in the GmDGAT2B gene in OAC Wallace was significantly associated with reduced seed oil concentration across three environments and reduced seed yield at Woodstock in 2010. A mutation in the 3' untranslated (3'UTR) region of GmDGAT2C was associated with seed yield at Woodstock in 2009. A mutation in the intronic region of GmDGAR1B was associated with seed yield and protein concentration at Ottawa in 2010. The genes identified in this study had minor effects on either seed yield or oil concentration, which was in agreement with the quantitative nature of the traits. However, the novel gene-specific markers designed in the present study can be used in soybean breeding for marker-assisted selection aimed at increasing seed yield and oil concentration with no significant impact on seed protein concentration.

   NS soybean cultivars were assessed for variability of and correlations between yield components and the effect of genotype environment interaction on yield, yield component and morphological characteristics. Experiments were carried out at Rimski Sancevi experiment field in 2009 and 2010. The following characteristics were evaluated: plant height (cm), height of first pod (cm), 1000-grain weight (g), grain yield (kg/ha) and the combined content of oil and protein in grain (%). Combined contents of oil and protein in grain soybean were determined by a non-destructive method of near infrared spectroscopy on PERTEN DA 7000 (NIR/VIS Spectrophotometer).
   The studied characteristics varied significantly depending on genotype and year. The highest yield of 5273 kg/ha was obtained in 2009 with the genotype Victoria. Highest 1000-grain weights, 2009-2010, were achieved with the genotypes Valjevka and Victoria (149.27 g and 147.23 g). Maximum heights of first pod (19.40 cm) were recorded for the genotype Victoria, 2009-2010. Highest protein contents were obtained with the genotypes Valjevka and Victoria, 2009-2010, were and highest oil contents (21.73%) with the genotype Tea. Protein content was positively significantly correlated with 1000-grain weight and negatively significantly correlated with oil content, and negatively correlated with yield and the height of first pod. Oil content was positively correlated with the height of first pod. Thousand-grain weight was negatively highly significantly correlated with oil content in grain and negatively significantly correlated the height of first pod.
   The results of this study should facilitate further soybean breeding for improved seed yield and protein and oil contents.

AB The aim of this research was to determine variability and correlations between yield, protein content and oil content in soybean cultivars. The research was carried out on ten NS soybean cultivars in 2008, 2009 and 2010. All of the analysed traits significantly varied depending on cultivar and year. The highest yield in the analysed period was found in cultivar Proteinka (4,947 kg ha(-1)) which was significantly higher than that of cultivars Becejka, Tara, Afrodita and Diva. The highest average yield in 2010 was found in cultivars Irina (5,590 kg ha(-1)) and Bdejka (5,340 kg ha(-1)). The highest protein content was found in cultivars Afrodita and Galina, while the highest oil content was found in cultivars Alisa, Valjevka and Alisa. Significantly higher yield were obtained in 2010, while significantly higher protein and oil content was recorded in 2008.
   Yield was insignificantly positively correlated with oil content both in 2008, 2009 and 2010 (0.06, 0.31 and 0.17, respectively), and negatively but not significantly correlated with protein content (-0.06, -0.12 and -0.19, respectively). Oil content was significantly negatively correlated with protein content (-0.47(star)) in 2009, while in 2008 and 2010 this correlation was insignificant (-0.25, -0.11).
   This research is a basis for further breeding of soybeans with improved grain yield and content of protein and oil.

   Stability of protein and oil content of 13 soybean varieties were examined using linear model across seven locations and during six years. Due to heterogeneity of environments all year/locations was distributed in to two groups, based on achieved yield. Stability of protein content differed in the low and high yielding environments, while average values show only minor differences. In contrast, oil content stability was slightly changed in the low and high yielding environments, while the average oil content were significantly higher in the low yielding environments. Environmental factors influenced the correlation between oil and protein content in soybeans. Negative correlation between protein and oil content was observed only in the high yielding environments, while varieties in low yielding environments lack this well known inverse relation.

AB Genotype x environment interaction influences the market value of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] protein, oil, and fatty acid traits. The objectives of this research were (i) to evaluate agronomic trait performance and stability of soybean genotypes in individual environments and across environments; and (ii) to evaluate the relationship of test environments for selecting superior genotypes within the mega-environment for soybean production in the southern region of Wisconsin. A total of 68 soybean genotypes were selected from University of Wisconsin soybean evaluation trials and grown at four locations in 2003 and 2004. Soybean genotypes, grown in trials with conventional and Roundup Ready herbicide treatments were analyzed for yield, protein, oil, and the fatty acid components palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, and linolenic acid. Repeatability estimates among genotypes ranged from 0.27 to 0.98 with yield and the fatty acid component linolenic acid being the most sensitive to environment effects. Superior genotypes could be consistently selected for yield, protein, oil, and fatty acid components using biplot analysis and stability estimates. Among locations in the southern region in Wisconsin, Arlington provides unique information for soybean fatty acid evaluations, but similar information about soybean yield, protein, and oil with Janesville or Lancaster. So, if soybean fatty acid is not important then Arlington could be dropped as a test site.

DE Soybean; production; yield; land use; long-term projection; exponential
   smoothing with damped trend
AB Soybeans (Glycine max) serve as one of the most valuable crops in the world, not only as an oil seed crop and feed for livestock and aquaculture, but also as a good source of protein for the human diet and as a biofuel feedstock. The world soybean production increased by 4.6% annually from 1961 to 2007 and reached average annual production of 217.6 million tons in 2005-07. World production of soybeans is predicted to increase by 2.2% annually to 371.3 million tons by 2030 using an exponential smoothing model with a damped trend. Finally, three scenarios and their implications are presented for increasing supply as land availability declines. The scenarios highlight for agribusiness policy makers and managers the urgent need for significant investments in yield improving research.

AB The objective of this research was to determine the genetic gain in grain yield and grain quality accomplished by recently developed domestic soybean elite lines and to determine ways to improve these traits further. Realized gains were estimated by comparing recently developed most promising domestic soybean lines of maturity groups (MGs) 00, 0 and I with commercial cultivars (standards) in comparative field tests during three consecutive years (2002-2004) in Osijek, Croatia. Mean values, broad-sense heritability, genetic gain and relative genetic gain from selection were calculated for grain yield, protein and oil content in grain. The obtained results of biometrical analysis showed genetic improvement in productivity and quality of new domestic soybean elite lines within MGs 00, 0 and I. The high agronomic performances of this breeding material will considerably contribute to the increasing and improving soybean production in our region as well as genetic improvement of domestic soybean cultivars further.

SO CROP SCIENCE

ID REGISTRATION
AB Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] seed yields often show a negative association with seed protein.  The objective of this study was to determine if this association could be minimized by crossing a high and a normal protein line of equal seed yield.  An F2 population of 1000 plants was grown.  Plants were harvested individually and seed evaluated for oil content using the nuclear magnetic resonance technique.  Two bulk populations were developed:  one included the 8% having the highest oil and the other the 8% having lowest oil.  With the high negative correlation between seed protein and oil, the low oil population was expected to provide lines having high seed protein concentration.  The two populations were advanced in bulk through the F6 generation, after which 200 plants were harvested individually from each population and 200 F7 lines grown from each.  The F7 lines were harvested individually and seed analyzed for seed protein and oil.  The 18 lines having the highest protein and the 18 lines having the highest oil were selected for further evaluation in replicated trials.  Lines were evaluated in five environments for seed yield, protein, and oil.  The overall mean seed yield of the high protein lines averaged 6% less than the overall mean of the lines selected for high oil; however, when seed yield of the two highest protein lines at each environment were compared with the two highest oil lines, the high protein lines had a 1% advantage in seed yield, an 18% advantage in seed protein, and a 20% reduction in oil.  The results demonstrate the potential for developing soybean lines high in seed protein and equal in seed yield to lines having high oil content.
